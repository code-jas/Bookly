• Automatic Information: We automatically collect and store certain types of information about your use of BOOKLY Services, including information about your interaction with content and services available through BOOKLY Services. Like many websites, we use "cookies" and other unique identifiers, and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser or device accesses BOOKLY Services and other content served by or on behalf of BOOKLY on other websites. 

• Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you from other sources, such as updated delivery and address information from our carriers, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase more easily. 

➤   For What Purposes Does BOOKLY Use Your Personal Information?
We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. These purposes include:

• Purchase and delivery of products and services. We use your personal information to take and handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, and communicate with you about orders, products and services, and promotional offers.

• Provide, troubleshoot, and improve BOOKLY Services. We use your personal information to provide functionality, analyze performance, fix errors, and improve the usability and effectiveness of the BOOKLY Services.

• Recommendations and personalization. We use your personal information to recommend features, products, and services that might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience with BOOKLY Services.

• Provide voice and image services. When you use our voice and image services, we use your voice input, images, videos, and other personal information to respond to your requests, provide the requested service to you, and improve our services.

• Comply with legal obligations. In certain cases, we collect and use your personal information to comply with laws. For instance, we collect information from sellers regarding place of establishment and bank account information for identity verification and other purposes.

• Communicate with you. We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to BOOKLY Services via different channels (e.g., by phone, e-mail, chat).

• Advertising. We use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. We do not use information that personally identifies you to display interest-based ads. To learn more, please read our Interest-Based Ads notice.

• Fraud Prevention and Credit Risks. We use personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect the security of our customers, our sellers, BOOKLY, and others. We may also use scoring methods to assess and manage credit risks.

➤   What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?
To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve BOOKLY Services, we use cookies and other identifiers. 

➤   Does BOOKLY Share Your Personal Information?
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. BOOKLY shares customers' personal information only as described below, with our Affiliates, and with our parent corporation Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries it controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

• Buying and Selling on BOOKLY: If you purchase or sell products via the BOOKLY websites, we will transmit your personal data to the respective contractual partner (buyer or seller) for the purpose of processing the contract. If you sell products via partner companies (including those not controlled by BOOKLY), in individual cases it can be necessary that we also transmit your personal data to these companies for the purpose of selling your products.

• Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

• Promotional Offers: Sometimes, we may send offers to selected groups of AbeBooks customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we don't give that business your name and address.

• Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that AbeBooks Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

• Protection of BOOKLY and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of BOOKLY, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

➤   How Secure Is Information About Me?
We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.

• We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.

• We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of personal customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.

• It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers and devices. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer or device.

➤   What About Advertising?

• Third Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites: BOOKLY Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps. Third party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at BOOKLY, including interest-based ads, please read our Interest-Based Ads policy.

• Use of Third Party Advertising Services: We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant BOOKLY ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other device identifier. For example, if you purchase a product, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event. Some ad companies use this information to serve you relevant ads from AbeBooks and other advertisers. 

➤   Which Information Can I Access?
You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile information, and purchase history in the "My Account" section of the website. 

➤    Are Children Allowed to Use AbeBooks Services?
BOOKLY does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use BOOKLY only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

➤   Conditions of Use, Notices and Revisions
• If you choose to use BOOKLY Services, your use and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Terms and Conditions, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the laws of Philippines. If you have any concern about privacy at BOOKLY, please contact us at privacy@BOOKLY.com with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.

• Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change also. You should check our website frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
